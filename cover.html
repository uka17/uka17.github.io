<b>Cover letter</b>
<br><br>
Dear Manisha,
<br>
Many years ago I’ve started my career as a Software Engineer. Later I joined FMCG company, continued to evolve as IT System Analyst, Team Lead, Tech Lead and Project Manager. Throughout this long career journey I always felt “call of code” and tried to be as much closer to the technical zone as I could: digging into SQL queries, developing web applications, implementing CI/CD and test driven development practices in my teams, managing “code first or database first” holly wars and doing lots of other hand-zone things in order to satisfy my technical hunger.
<br>
At curtain career stage I faced an opportunity to become a people manager. I took this challenge and started to develop my people and stakeholder management skills, continued as a manager of people managers and now I’ve ended up as Senior IT Manager at cluster level.
Recently I realised that my role is drifting away from software and computer science, and more toward the business. My time is getting monopolised by business and operational tasks. I'm stacking in back2back meetings and calls, politics, presentations and endless steering committees. I decided to start chasing new challenges and opportunities and apply for position of Engineering Manager at Blocket.
<br>
Having almost 12 years of IT background in both B2C and Operations of FMCG company dealing with project, service, application development and people management, I'm looking for new software development opportunities. Solid management background and technical expertise make me, I do believe, a great candidate for this position. 
I would love to have an opportunity to share more details about my previous experience, answering your questions and learning more about this position. 
<br>
<br>
Thank you for taking time to consider my credentials.
<br> 
Respectfully, 
<br>
Nikolai
