Dear Hiring Manager,
<br>
Many years ago I’ve started my career as a Software Engineer. Later I joined FMCG company, continued to evolve as Software Engineer, Team Lead, Tech Lead and Project Manager. Throughout this long career journey I was digging into SQL queries, developing web applications and Windows services, implementing CI/CD and test driven development practices in my teams, managing “code first or database first” holly wars and doing lots of other hand-zone things in order to satisfy my technical hunger.
<br>
At curtain career stage I faced an opportunity to become a people manager. I took this challenge and started to develop my people and stakeholder management skills, continued as a manager of people managers and now I’ve ended up as Senior IT Manager.
<br>
Having almost 12 years of background in both B2C and Operations of FMCG company, dealing with software development, project and people management, I'm looking for new opportunities. Solid management background and technical expertise make me, I do believe, a great candidate for this position. 
I would love to have an opportunity to share more details about my previous experience, answering your questions and learning more about this position. 
<br>
<br>
Thank you for taking time to consider my credentials.
<br> 
Respectfully, 
<br>
Nikolai
