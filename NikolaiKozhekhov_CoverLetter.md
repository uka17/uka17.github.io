Dear Human Resources Team,

I am pleased to be applying for the Engineering Manager position at Mentimeter.

We are using Mentimeter for different teambuilding and out of work activities (e.g. hobby and IT meetups) at my current workplace. I would say it is a perfect tool for icebreaking and overcoming communication barriers. For our introvert IT team this tool is very helpful. Having an opportunity to contribute to such kind of service allows to combine both: making this world better through delivering good technically smart things and personal satisfaction from observation of results here and now. This is exactly what I’m looking for currently.

Having almost 12 years of IT background in both B2C and Operations of FMCG company dealing with project, service and people management, I’m looking for opportunities to get closer to the software development domain. Despite the fact I have been developing people management skills I do my best to preserve all my technical skills, expertise and knowledge by coding during out of work time for personal pleasure and satisfaction. Solid management background and technical expertise make me a great candidate for this position.
I would love to have an opportunity to share more details about my previous experience, answering your questions and learning more about this position.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards, Nikolai.
